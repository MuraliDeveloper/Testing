Types of s/w companies:
- Product based..
- Service based..


Product : 
build their own product and sell to market.

Target to developo s/w for multiple customers.
[Req gathering + Requiremnets + impl + dev + testing]
==>market analysis , predective analysis , study customers 
undertand need of customer and they develop the apaplication.
application is consumed by multi customers.
ex: 
win os , facebook , wats up, google , amazon...



Service based:
build product for other companies.

enduser --> abc corp  -----> Amazon
Requirement gather will be done by the abc corp and
development/testing/support is taken care by the Amazon company.


S/W company perform sdlc for a specific customer[business ].
Requirement gather will be done by the customer and
development is taken care by the s/w company.


software testing:
------------------
- is a phase of sdlc.
- aims at the capabilities of the application.
- intended to identify problem areas/bugs/issues/defect.
ex:
correct creds + login failure --> critical defect.
login buton has to be in blue , was in red : low defect.
in fb , along with image upload , text msg is not added: medium

Defect--> any scenario/ any test case which is not working
as per customer specification.
- check whethere application meets the customer requirements.
- identify any gaps/miscommunication.
- Tester is the 1st customer.

Nov 11th:
--------------
v20--> consumed by customer.[ login , inbox ]
V21---> 
New requiremnts[draft] + 10 defects for login,inbox.
Fix the defects first and then procced with new requirements.


Testing:
1.Manual testing - no tool/technology for testing
- sql , sqldeveloper
- process tools:  wiki , github ,svn , Jira, jenkins 

2.automation testing. 
-need tool/language for testing.
- html
- java
- selenium
- testng

Requiremnt gap:
-----------
for success login -> show home page
for all failure case -> show invalid credentials.
for account locked --> show acocunt locked. 

test case:
1. login name is corect  + pwd correct ---> show home page
2. login name is corect  + pwd wrong ---> show login page 
                 with msg invalid credentials.
3. login name is wrong  + pwd wrong ---> show login page 
                 with msg invalid credentials.
4. login name is corect  + pwd correct ,
but account is locked
 ---> show login page 
                 with msg acocunt locked.
				 
				 
				 
Why Testing:
-> fixing the issue after delivery is expensive.
-> ensure the software is 100% bug free.
-> ensure app meets the quality [perf + funtional+ non -functional], stable , security.
-> ensure quality delivery.

Quality:[from business view]
---------
-> Bug free
-> funtional is as expected
-> On time delivery ,[No extenstions...] 
-> On budget.
-> Performance [app should not slow]
-> app should support future requirements.
-> No crashes/ no conituous restarts.
