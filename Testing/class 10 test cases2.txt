2.Should we show the message on the same screen or new screen?login success or login failure
Ans2. Login success should come in a new screen and login failure should come on same screen.

Ans3.If user name is empty then this screen should show a pop up menu asking "please enter user name". This is a client's side validation.

Terms:

1)Client's side validation (the check is done at client's side, but the call is not submittted to the back side eg: psw has to 8 digit, psw should not be empty, age can't be greater than 100, age should be a number, date of birth should be in numbers not alphabets, only syntax(use in proper format) related checks at client's side)

2)Server's side validation (validation will happens only after submitting the data to the backend eg: check if username is correct, check if psw is correct)

Test Case:

1) Check for login success under valid credentials.(username correct, psw is correct)
2) Check for login faliure under invalid credentials.(username correct, psw is wrong)
3) Check for login faliure under invalid credentials.(username wrong, psw is wrong)
4) Check for pop msg if User name is empty.
5) Check for pop msg if password is empty
