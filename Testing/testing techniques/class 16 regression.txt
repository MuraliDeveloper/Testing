Regression Testing is required when there is a

-Change in requirements and code is modified according to the requirement
-New feature is added to the software
-Defect fixing
-Performance issue fix.
- avoid the side effects 


Diff between retets and regression:
-----------------------------------------
Retesting means testing the functionality or bug again to ensure the code is fixed. If it is not fixed, Defect needs to be re-opened. If fixed, Defect is closed.
- retest with multi diff input to confirm business validation


Regression testing means testing your software application when it undergoes a code change to ensure that the new code has not affected other parts of the software.

challenges:
-------------------------------
 
With successive regression runs, test suites become fairly large.  Due to time and budget constraints, the entire regression test suite cannot be executed
Minimizing the test suite while achieving maximum Test coverage remains a challenge
Determination of frequency of Regression Tests, i.e., after every modification or every build update or after a bunch of bug fixes, is a challenge.





monkey testing:
-------------------
test the application without test cases and without knowledge of the application.
