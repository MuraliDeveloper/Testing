ABC cop --> client/customer

Amazon --> team

SDLC:
-----
PROCESS/FRAMEWORK DEFINES DIFF ACTIVITIES DURIG THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.
- SEQUNCE OF STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED FOR S/W DEV.

2.Design
3.Coding
4.Unit Testing
5.Testing
6.Build + deployment
7.maintainance + support



ACTIVITIES:
-----------
1.Analysis   (Req gathering):[WHAT TO DO] [DISCUSS FUNTIONALLY]
 Abc corp shares requirement to Amazon

--> artitechts, tech leads(java,qa lead,ui lead , db lead)
collecting ingradients for feature devlopement.

time estimation  + how many people + what are tasks +
HLL DESIGN
+ technical challenges + impact on existing.
+ scope 
FEASIABILITY

flow of data --- (customer)UI --->Java---> DB


tester has to prepare test cases before coding and review with developers and qa lead.

testers start with automation test scripts.
testers create test data required for testing.
