Why do we have bugs/defects:
----------------------------
-> Req gap
-> Missing scenario [ignorance].
-> edge scenario [unexpected].
ex: 
every department has multi employees.
requirement : show department , if we click on department 
show the employees.

tester way :
-> create department and add employees immdeiately.
[department should be shown]

-> edge sceraio create department without employees. 
[department should not shown]

business case:
-> create department today.
-> and add employees after next week.


-> missing test case
-> Bad coding practises.- [developers]
-> change in requirement in between 
-> faster delivery , [testing is not done 100%]
 - lack of time
-> load/perf test is not appropiate.
-> testing is not done well by testers.- lack of intent


testing steps:
--------------
-> test data creation.  [ex: registration , signup, create account] 
-> test executions   , login success, login failure, 
-> for every test execution validate.
-> test data cleanup [clean data used for registration].

SKills for tester:
-------------------
-> Understanding system + requirements.
-> Follow Testing process/protocal.
-> Estimation. ex: time required for testing.
-> Comunication skills + analytical skills.
-> Puntucal + Time mgmt.
-> Documentation.
[write article abt the requirements/testcases/test plan.]
->  commitment , intent towards work.
