ex:unit testing
final s/w not ready

validation:
what ever developed is working as per customer req.

Reviews:
--------
done by qa lead
requirement reviews

code reviews
test plan reviews
test cases reviews




Min Levels of software testing:
--------------------------
Unit testing
Integration
System testing
UAT


UT:
----
Junits
done by dev
test singl unit using code
white box testing(with knowing coding)

system test:
---------------
test the integrated system , final product.
done by testers
black box(without knowing coding)
->funtional
db test,
regression
->non funtional (mostly on stability)
per +load +stress+security +compatability+ installation +recovery +configuration
-> GUI
-> usability

UAT:
------
done by customers/users at their env
black box
test on final system
- tested at customer environment
->Alpha (test with real time data)
->Beta 


integration
-------------
integrate all software and start testing
o/p of a prog is input to another system.
done by developer
